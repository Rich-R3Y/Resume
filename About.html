                <hr/>
                <p>Hello! I am Richard, the creator of this website and here you will get to know a bit more about myself.</p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>Some of my hobbies are: Robotics, Programming, MMA, Art, Weightlifting, Cooking, Playing the guitar, Videogames, etc.</p>
            <h2>Aspirations and Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to become a Software Engineer in the upcoming years to earn a lot of money and mainly to develop my own applications as I feel I have a few great ideas that could work. Attend college in Mexico(I am currently pursuing a Computer Science degree) to study mechanical, electrical engineering and maybe nutrition. Move to Dallas, TX and travel from Dallas to Montarrey Nl, Mexico back and forth. Move to Mexico far in the future to live there and travel the world. Fall in love, have a loving family.
